# FirstUnityGameJam
This was a small group game jam from 2019. No one in the group knew how to use unity and we definitely dove off the deep end.

Since this was made by such inexperienced players I'll let ya in on how to get through the levels.

*space bar to "attack"*

Level 1:
 well just walk to the end of the level
 
Level 2:
 there is a secret hole in the wall on the right side. Be warry of the trees they can push you through the floor and dont fall off the edge. It will respawn you at the start of level 1
 
Level 3:
 dieing on this one is okay it just restarts the level. once at the end wall keep holding forwards as well as right.
 
Level 4:
 do you're best to kill the boss with its increadible animations
